## Task Management Application

### Overview
The Task Management Application is a web-based application built with React that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can create task lists, add tasks to the lists, update task details, mark tasks as completed, move tasks between lists using drag and drop, and export task lists to Excel files.

### Features

1. **Task Lists**
   - Users can create multiple task lists, such as "Personal," "Work," or "Shopping."
   - Each task list will have a title and will be displayed as a separate section in the application.
   - Users can switch between task lists to view and manage tasks specific to each list.

2. **Task Cards**
   - Users can add task cards to the task lists.
   - Each task card will have the following details:
     - task list
   - Task cards will be displayed within their respective task lists.

3. **Create and Update Tasks**
   - Users can create new tasks by clicking on the "Add Task" button within a task list.
   - A form will be displayed where users can enter the task details.
   - Users can update the details of a task by clicking on the task card and modifying the relevant information in a form.

4. **Delete Tasks**
   - Users can delete tasks by selecting the task card and choosing the delete option.
   - A confirmation prompt will be displayed to confirm the deletion.

5. **Task Status**
   - Users can mark tasks as completed or active.
   - Completed tasks will be visually differentiated from active tasks, e.g., by applying a strikethrough style or using different colors.

6. **Drag and Drop**
   - Users can move tasks between lists using drag and drop functionality.
   - Tasks can be dragged from one list and dropped into another list to change their category or status.

7. **Export to Excel**
   - Users can export task lists to Excel files for further analysis or sharing.
   - An export button will be provided, which, upon clicking, will generate and download an Excel file.
   - The Excel file will include all the task details, such as title, description, status, and due date.

### Architecture and Technologies Used

- **React**: The application will be built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React DnD**: React DnD will be used for implementing drag and drop functionality between task lists.
- **React typescript**: react typescript
- **React-icons**:  to show icons
- **ExcelJS**: ExcelJS is a JavaScript library that allows generating Excel files. It can be used to export task lists to Excel format.
- **CSS Framework**: A CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI can be used for styling and layout of the application.

### Development Plan

1. **Project Setup**
   - Set up a new React project using Create React App or any preferred boilerplate.
   - Install the required dependencies, including React DnD, React Router, and ExcelJS.
   - Create the necessary project structure and components, such as the main app component, task list component, and task card component.

2. **Task List and Task Card Components**
   - Implement the task list component to display the task lists.
   - Create the task card component to render individual task cards within the task lists.
   - Include placeholders for the task details and status indicators.

3. **Add Task Functionality**
   - Implement the "Add Task" button within the task list component.
   - Create a form component to capture the task details and handle the form submission.
   - Add logic to create a new task card and update the task list when a task is added.

4. **Update and Delete Tasks**
   - Implement the logic to update task details when a task card is clicked.
   - Create a form component to edit the task details and handle the update functionality.
   - Add logic to delete a task card and update the task list accordingly.

5. **Task Status and Styling**
   - Implement the functionality to mark tasks as completed or active.
   - Apply appropriate styling to differentiate completed tasks from active tasks.

6. **Drag and Drop**
   - Integrate React DnD to enable drag and drop functionality between task lists.
   - Implement the logic to handle the movement of tasks from one list to another.

7. **Export to Excel**
   - Implement the export functionality to generate Excel files.
   - Use ExcelJS to populate the task details in the Excel file format.
   - Provide a button or option to trigger the export and allow users to download the generated Excel file.

8. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Test the application thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   - Refine the user interface, layout, and styling as needed.
   - Optimize the performance of the application.

9. **Deployment and Launch**
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform or server.
   - Make the application publicly accessible for users to access and start managing their tasks.

### Conclusion

The Task Management Application provides users with a convenient way to manage their tasks effectively. By allowing them to create task lists, add tasks, update task details, mark tasks as completed, move tasks between lists, and export task lists to Excel files, the application streamlines the task management process. With an intuitive and user-friendly interface, users can stay organized and prioritize their work efficiently.
